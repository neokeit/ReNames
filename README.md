# ReNames

'Ranames' is a program to rename multiple files at once. By configuring renaming methods, the names can be manipulated in a number of ways.

It's easy to set up a batch job using multiple methods on a large number of files. With 'Ranames' you can create new file names by adding, removing, replacing, case changing or position based file renaming. Before performing operations on the files, you can verify that the output will be correct.
